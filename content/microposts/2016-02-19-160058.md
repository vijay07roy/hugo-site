After spending a month or so building an API in Go, I'm really liking the idea of server-side Swift. Go is nice, but I like the idea of an iOS app and the API it consumes in the same language. This was in today's [iOS Dev Weekly](https://iosdevweek.ly): [Hello Server Side Swift](https://medium.com/@LogMaestro/server-side-swift-c965b7ebe6e7#.1yk8mcukc).
