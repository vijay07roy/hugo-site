Tonight I finished my “[@meetup](https://twitter.com/meetup) crossover” by completing the second part of my two parter about cross platform development. [Part 1 at CocoaHeads October](https://speakerdeck.com/jnjosh/cross-platform-shenanigans-part-1-ios) discussed it with Xcode, [part 2 was tonight at TriDroid](https://speakerdeck.com/jnjosh/cross-platform-shenanigans-part-2-android) discussed with Android Studio.
