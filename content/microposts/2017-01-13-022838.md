I just realized that *January 5* was the **6th anniversary** of the [Triangle CocoaHeads meetup](http://meetup.com/nscoderrtp). I actually started it outside of [meetup.com](http://meetup.com) for a few months with little luck. Moving it to meetup's site really helped us grow. Well, that and having a great community, great speakers, and consistent meetings. After a couple years of inconsistent meetings, I'm trying to get that consistency back this year.
