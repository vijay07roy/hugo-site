I’ve just scratched the surface with [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), it’s such a powerful idea. They call it “serverless computing”, but really it’s “I don’t want to think about servers” computing. As a client developer, I don’t want to have to care about servers but I want to be able to create things and having a remote service is an important part of this. [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [OpenWhisk](https://developer.ibm.com/openwhisk/), and [Azure’s Service Fabric](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-azure-service-fabric-reducing-complexity-in-a-hyper-scale-world/) seem to all be tackling the same idea. I can’t wait for Apple to release something in this area as part of iCloud or CloudKit. How cool would it be to define a worker in Xcode and just deploy it as part of a target?
