At tonight's [CocoaHeads](http://www.meetup.com/nscoderrtp/events/228529909/), I did a small talk on using Server Side Swift and deploying it with [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com). Everything was going fine until the [Swift Web Framework](https://github.com/qutheory/vapor) I was using crashed. Turns out someone pushed a breaking change in the 30 minutes between my test run and my live demo. This is why you don't do live demos and don't rely on latest from a remote repository.
