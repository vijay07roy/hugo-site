I’m always interested in and on the [lookout for a great todo app](/posts/todo-fails/). This week [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/) was released and it is an amazing set of apps—from the UI to the simplicity to the little bounce when you shrink the window. I predict an Apple Design Award in it’s future.
