I just open sourced the theme for this blog on Github. I think some of the things I do are not standard to Hugo, so I wrote some extensive documentation too. If you like this blog's theme, check out internet-weblog on Github, [https://github.com/jnjosh/internet-weblog](https://github.com/jnjosh/internet-weblog).
