Okay, it’s not even a real issue but I’ve decided to stick with the 12.9” iPad Pro. New Apple releases always get me excited but the new 9.7” is underpowered compared to my existing iPad, it just doesn’t make sense to “upgrade”. I’m not the [only one](http://www.manton.org/2016/03/sticking-with-the-big-ipad-pro.html) thinking this way either. I’ve actually started using my iPad Pro a little more with the Apple Pencil. For a few years I’ve been doing the [Bullet Journal](http://bulletjournal.com) method on paper, now I’m writing these notes in [Notability](http://www.gingerlabs.com/) and I get all the benefits of it being digital—syncing, embedded images, etc.
