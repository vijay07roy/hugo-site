Last year I [listened to a lot of books](/posts/listeningisreading/) and it was great. This year I hope to to more. Also, more reading of print books. This snowy weekend I read through a book about comics, _[Understanding Comics](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Comics-Invisible-Scott-McCloud/dp/006097625X)_ by Scott McCloud. It explores the history of sequential art and breaks down the tools used to communicate ideas. If you are interested in comics—whether it is as a reader or creator—it is well worth the read.
