I love my [sonos](http://www.sonos.com). It’s a great speaker and they just opened up Apple Music support, which is the service I currently use. So… yay! Right? Well the client is not very good. I don’t like using it at all. It looks like something from 2005 to me. Luckily I found the [AirSonos project on Github](https://github.com/stephen/airsonos). Now I can play music on my headphones or just stream to the Sonos directly. It’s also a really interesting Open Source project and [he provides more info on how it worked on this medium post, “Hacking AirPlay into Sonos”](https://medium.com/@stephencwan/hacking-airplay-into-sonos-93a41a1fcfbb#.y6ginqc1l).
