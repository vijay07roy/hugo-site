CocoaHeads started up again this week with a talk by [Ameir Al-Zoubi](https://twitter.com/ameir) about `NSDate` and related concepts and a talk by [Rob Napier](https://twitter.com/cocoaphony) about applying lessons from functional programming to Swift. Both talks were really great and we had a pretty well attended meeting. If you didn't make it, stay tuned to [http://cocoaheads.tv](http://cocoaheads.tv) for the videos!
