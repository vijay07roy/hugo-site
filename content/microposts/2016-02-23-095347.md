So I bought one of those “mattress in a box” mattresses. It arrives today and I'm super excited. I've been getting horrible sleep lately and I think our 15 year old spring mattress gets some of the blame. We reviewed a lot of different ones and ended up picking [the Purple mattress](http://onpurple.com). It had some great reviews and probably one of the [funniest videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN9ayoV1EXg).
