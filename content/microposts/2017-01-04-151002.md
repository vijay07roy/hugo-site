Ever since I started really learning how to draw back in October, I'm starting to develop a sketchbook addiction. As of now I have 11 sketchbooks and 4 of them I'm actively using. I've found that it's much easier to overcome my laziness by leaving sketchbooks at all the places I frequently sit. Then I have no excuse to not pick it up and draw.
