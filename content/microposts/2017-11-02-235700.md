Earlier this week I merged in some updates to [my “internet weblog” theme for hugo](https://github.com/jnjosh/internet-weblog), mostly to bring it up to the latest Hugo version. I also noticed it’s the only theme with the [microblog tag](https://themes.gohugo.io/tags/microblog) so if you want to host your own [microblog](https://micro.blog), check it out!
