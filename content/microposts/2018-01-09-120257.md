I've had this problem in Xcode where it breaks on `SIGPIPE` when I disconnect from our WebSocket implementation. Today I learned about this lldb command: `pro hand -p true -s false SIGPIPE`. Xcode [doesn't load the .lldbinit](https://openradar.appspot.com/23671344) file so I had to improvise. A shared symbolic break point on our socket connection method did the trick.
