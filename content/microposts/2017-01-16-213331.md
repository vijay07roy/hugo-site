So **sous vide** is really fun. The idea is you cook under specific temperatures for a longer time so that you can reach the desired “done-ness”, usually under a vacuum. For example, cooking a steak on the grill for a long time is a difficult way to get there. With _sous vide_, Medium is just 136º for an hour. Then you sear it and enjoy. I picked up the [Anova Precision Cooker](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HHWSV1S/ref=twister_B01BTNRUWW?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1) on Amazon and haven't regretted it once.
