My wife has been learning R and working on RStudio. [Today she started a new blog](https://thedatawitch.com) using Hugo and Netlify. There is a plugin called [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) for RStudio which makes this pretty easy to setup and handles running the R code and attaching any output to the post.
