New Apple announcements today, I really liked how Tim Cook opened the event talking about their position in the privacy issue, their goals to use renewable energy, and the new Carekit SDK. I'll be getting a new 9.7" iPad Pro as soon as I can sell my 12.9" iPad Pro. The new one seems like the perfect iPad to me especially with that True Tone stuff. I've already bought my new watch band.
