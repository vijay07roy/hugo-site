I came across this [aggregate of all 100-books-to-read-before-you-die lists](https://medium.com/world-literature/creating-the-ultimate-list-100-books-to-read-before-you-die-45f1b722b2e5?source=linkShare-6c7e1959adde-1509325385). I’ve always wanted to read more so why wait? Starting tonight, I’ll be reading the first on the list: “The Great Gatsby”. I read it once in high school so it will be fun to read again.
