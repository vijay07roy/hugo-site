A couple weeks ago I bought an [Amazon Echo](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00X4WHP5E/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00X4WHP5E&linkCode=as2&tag=jnjoshsintern-20&linkId=YU5HFH5LWBVOUCZO). The smart home takeover of my home has begun. I've already bought WiFi power outlets to control my lights and have added an [“Alexa Skill” to control sonos](https://github.com/rgraciano/echo-sonos). I think this is could be a big thing if Amazon can maintain interest in it. It handles real speech much better than Siri and is much more open to automation.
