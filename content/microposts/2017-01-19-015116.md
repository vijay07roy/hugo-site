I'm spinning up on a small new project and, well I have to say it, I miss having [Parse](https://www.parse.com) available as a service. Thankfully it's open-sourced so maybe I should use it to develop this idea. I looked into [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com), but it doesn't fit my mental model of what I need. I could go to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) but that's serious overkill. Okay, I just microblog-convinced myself to use open-sourced Parse. I mean it's a small dataset without a user concept so it should be pretty easy to move later.
