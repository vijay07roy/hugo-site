Yesterday I blogged about [TODO lists not living up](/posts/TODO-fails/) to my expectations. I should have been more clear but didn't realize it to later. It's not any of the apps themselves that have the problem. It's me. I'm the problem. `Present-Josh` doesn't care what `Past-Josh` thinks is important and just ignores it. Anyway, I found a new one I'm trying that at least provides the one-thing-at-a-time point of view that I'd like to have. It's called [Doo](https://getdooapp.com).
