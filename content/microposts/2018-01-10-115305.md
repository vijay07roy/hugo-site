Yesterday I did [this LLDB thing](https://jnjosh.com/microposts/2018-01-09-120257/) to avoid an unnecessary breakpoint that occured on ‘`SIGPIPE`’. It works great but I keep seeing it updated by Xcode. I don't need to track updates so I learned a new git trick: `git update-index --assume-unchanged <file>`.
