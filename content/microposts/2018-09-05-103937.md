In writing some guidelines to how we use JIRA at [Highrise](https://hashtagme.app), I wrote “It's more about why we are creating this feature and less about being just a todo list”. We have too many tasks that are “Design This”, ”Build Thing”, and none that carry the idea that _this is for a person_ from idea through design and developlement.
