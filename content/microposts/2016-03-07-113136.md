I’ve occasionally been working at [The Frontier](http://www.rtp.org/about-us/the-frontier/) in RTP during the week. We have a small office there and I’ve noticed I don’t like using my headphones when in there. So I picked up a [UE Roll Bluetooth Speaker](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00YARCGHO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00YARCGHO&linkCode=as2&tag=jnjoshsintern-20&linkId=BJ6QR2EVQFCDBE72) based on a [Wirecutter recommendation](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-bluetooth-speaker/). I’m really happy with it. It is small but heavy, feels durable, and sounds great.
