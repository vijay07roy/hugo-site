Daredevil season 2 was pretty great. I'm happy overall with the Netflix section of the Marvel cinematic universe but I really wish that they'd do a little bit more of the crossover stuff. Marvel movies (and comics) are often fun because of who shows up. How awesome would it have been for Spider-Man to show up when Daredevil was on the rooftops listening for crime?
