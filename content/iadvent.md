# iAdvent for iPhone

The first iPhone application I designed and developed in the fall of 2008. I've removed it from sale in 2010 but it had some small successes and it's icon was featured in an [Apple Store window display](/posts/my-iphone-apps-icon-in-the-apple-storefront-display/).

<br />

iAdvent was a Christmas Countdown calendar that helps you keep track of how many days left until
Christmas. Like traditional advent calendars, each day has a box for you to tap on. Inside each
box is a fun Christmas fact, which you can email to your friends and family if you choose. The boxes
are designed to emulate the look of iPhone app icons, giving Advent a modern look that goes with the
sleek design of your favorite gadget.

Also like traditional calendars, iAdvent begins counting down on December 1st. Until then, play the
fun Christmas word game included and download 5 Christmas-themed wallpapers for your iPhone!
