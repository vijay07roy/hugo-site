This year I decided to attend the [Release Notes](https://2017.releasenotes.tv) Conference in Chicago. We decided to stretch the trip out a bit and make it a mini-vacation giving us an opportunity to explore Chicago and see [Hamilton](http://www.hamiltonbroadway.com/#chicago).

On our way back from Chicago, we bought tickets to see the [Foo Fighters](https://www.foofighters.com) in Lexington, Ky. Unfortunately the show was postponed, but driving through Kentucky gave us the opportunity to visit the [Louisville Slugger Museum and Factory](http://sluggermuseum.com).
