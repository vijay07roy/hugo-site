Realm, which posts amazing videos regularly, has just posted a [Guide to Functional Reactive Programming](https://realm.io/news/frp-ios-guide/). They discuss the why, the what, the how, and the who all while linking to some great videos. Definitely a nice resource if you haven't looked into this. I've read a lot about it but I don't think I've fully internalized this yet. This will definitely help.
