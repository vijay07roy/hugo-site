In 2012 I [launched](/posts/introducing-cocoaheads-tv/) [CocoaHeads.TV](https://cocoaheads.tv) as a site that could aggregate CocoaHeads videos from around the world. We had some really great success and people from [Australia](https://cocoaheads.tv/videos/world/australia/), [China](https://cocoaheads.tv/videos/world/china/), [France](https://cocoaheads.tv/videos/world/france/), [Germany](https://cocoaheads.tv/videos/world/germany/), and [many groups in the US](https://cocoaheads.tv/videos/world/us/) started submitting videos. Unfortunately, I didn't build it to make it easy to submit and I became the bottle neck to adding new videos. No more!

I've relaunched [CocoaHeads.TV](https://cocoaheads.tv) with a redesign and I'll be asking for CocoaHeads organizers to join the site and post their videos. I've also created a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cocoaheadstv) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/cocoaheadstv) account so you can keep up to date. 

I'm also very interested in feedback, if you have any comments or requests [let me know](https://twitter.com/jnjosh)!
