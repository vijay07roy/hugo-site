Apparently I’m not the only one named “Josh Johnson” that has a problem with German numbers. Here is a web-based game by another Josh Johnson to help with your German number learning. It also uses [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) which is something I’ve been wanting to play with. You can see the [code on Github](http://joshuajohnson.co.uk/NumberRush/).
