Over at [Two Toasters](http://twotoasters.com) we've started a blog to discuss technical topics around iOS (and Android) development called __Toastmo__.

Lately I've been pushing everyone to use UIAppearance in their work and custom views. Today we posted an article I wrote about it that covers all the basics and gives a few examples of implementing the protocol to help your own views.

UPDATE: This post is no longer online. Sorry.
