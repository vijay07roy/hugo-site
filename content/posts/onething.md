I feel like I link to [Manton Reece](http://www.manton.org) all the time here. His blog is really the reason for why I’ve started blogging again. I often struggle with the dilemma of choice when it comes to things to get done. Work stuff is easier because someone is depending on you. It’s so easy to rationalize away your own goals. This idea of getting one thing done really resonates with me. Using something like [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) or any task system, you can even try to get one thing done in some fixed set of time.
