This is a new reusable metal filter. Supposedly lets more of the tasty coffee oils through. Looks really cool, I've already backed it.

I'm really excited about getting this filter. I don't think I can taste the paper, but I really do like the aspect of not having to keep replacing paper filters.

I'm still really happy with the Aeropress. If you haven't gotten one yet, one of the kickstarter backing plans will send you a new Aeropress with the metal filter.
