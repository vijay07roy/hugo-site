I am working on a small app at the office for all our mac users to help locate files on the network (more on this later), I decided to go with a spotlight style NSStatusItem based app. Iâ€™ve been really inspired by these apps lately (when done right). Mostly thanks to Notify.

To make this more handy I decided to include a global hotkey. For Leopard and earlier, one problem is you have to use the old Carbon-based events. Most likely due to my Carbon-naivety, I had troubles with this.

Luckily, I found that starting with OS X Snow Leopard, Apple added a new method to NSEvent:

{{< highlight Objective-C >}}
 -addGlobalMonitorForEventsMatchingMask:maskhandler:
{{< / highlight >}}
