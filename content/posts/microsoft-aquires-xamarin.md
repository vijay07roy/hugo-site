Interesting, and unsurprising, news today that Xamarin has been acquired by Microsoft. I've never used it directly to build apps but I did to some research into using their test cloud system (which is actually calabash-based, something [I've worked a lot with and have written about before](/posts/cocoaheads-talk-calabash/)). I hear of a lot of people loving to be able to build iOS apps without learning Objective-C or Swift. 

This gives Microsoft an interesting position as a vendor of an iOS SDK. It will be interesting to see what comes of this.
