I really enjoyed this post about using Things 3. I've [been using it](/microposts/2017-05-20-175743/) off and on since last year but this post has already changed how I structure my projects. The funny thing is I now have more areas and projects but I don't feel as overloaded as when I had a more dense hierarchy. I previously had projects children of companies or bigger contexts. Now projects have their own area.
