Over the last month I've been using the [Go language](https://golang.org) more
and more. It's a pretty fun language but I often find myself wishing I was writing Swift.
I came across this new static engine system that was written in Go and thought I'd
try it out. It's called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). I don't have anything bad to
say about [Octopress](http://octopress.org), and a new version is coming soon.
But wow, Hugo is fast. Crazy fast.

During the process of moving my blog over to this new system I decided to borrow
some inspiration from [Manton Reese](http://www.manton.org) and actually have small
tweet-like microblog that is hosted right here. Hugo made it super easy as it was
just another content type. Manton talks a lot about [this idea on his blog](http://www.manton.org/2015/04/how-to-start-a-microblog.html)â€”and has a product
shipping someday that I think is based on the idea. Charles Perry of
[Release Notes](http://releasenotes.tv) has [also started a microblog](http://dazeend.org/2016/02/dazeend-org-microblog/).

I also decided to take it a step further and create a `photopost` that I could
share some photos from a trip or a conference. I don't blog often but this has made
it slightly easier to do. Maybe the fun of `microposts` and `photoposts` mixed with
the ease of writing a post will help. We'll see. I know I _want_ to blog, but life
and work always seem to interfere.

In the future, I'll be writing a few more posts about Hugo too. Not only did I
move the blog over but I made it a theme that you can use if you like. I'm also
looking at some systems to auto-build and deploy when I commit a new post. More
on this later.
