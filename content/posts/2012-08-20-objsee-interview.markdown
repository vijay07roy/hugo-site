I had the honor of being interviewed by [ObjectiveSee](http://objectivesee.com) which is a great site featuring Interviews with Apple iOS and Mac developers.

I really like what [Justin Watt](https://twitter.com/wattjustin) is doing with that site and it really is cool to be listed with the other developers there.

Some of the other cool interviews to check out are (to name just a few, because they are all good): [Josh Abernathy](http://www.objectivesee.com/josh.abernathy.html), [Loren Brichter](http://www.objectivesee.com/loren.brichter.html), [Mike Rundle](http://www.objectivesee.com/mike.rundle.html), and [Sam Soffes](http://www.objectivesee.com/sam.soffes.html).
