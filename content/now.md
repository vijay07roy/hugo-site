# What I'm doing now

- Working at [Grubhub](https://www.grubhub.com) as a team lead on the Foundation team for the Diner facing iOS app.

- Organizing [CocoaHeads](https://meetup.com/nscoderrtp). We are currently doing a bi-weekly meetup—A Swift Dinner—but I'm starting to think about restarting CocoaHeads.

- Learning to play the guitar… again. When I was a teenager my Dad bought me a cheap Squier Stratocaster. I learned the Nirvana nevermind tabs and some others, then let it go dormant. This time I'm trying to actually learn to play the instrument.

- Learning to Draw. This has taken a second seat to guitar, but I still try to draw at least once a day.
